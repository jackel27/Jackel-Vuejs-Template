## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

I use this setup quite often, figured I would have it available when need be. This is of course modified with the help of Vue-Cli(Webpack). More information can be found [here.]('https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack')
